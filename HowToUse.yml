(don't forget to create a .env file, defining DATABASE_URL=<your url>)
Then,
- To start the bot go to the dist directory and start "index.js" with pm2

Extra:

In the prisma Directory Open up the schema.prisma With VSC (or any type of editor you use)

Keep everything default But, under the provider = prisma-client-js
Put binaryTargets ["native", "Type"]
